# BRAIN-WAVE-CONTROLLED-ROBOT | Arduino UNO, MATLAB, Neuro View

Introduction:-

The proposed project leverages advanced NeuroSky biosensors as a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) to assist individuals with paralysis, such as paraplegics and quadriplegics, in achieving independent mobility. The system processes Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to interpret attention and meditation levels, enabling precise control of a motorized wheelchair for directional movement. Additionally, eye blink detection through infrared sensors allows the control of home appliances, such as lights and fans. This hardware-centric approach, integrating microcontrollers, wireless communication modules (e.g., Bluetooth or RF), and motor control units, empowers individuals with limited or no muscular activity to navigate their surroundings independently and control essential devices, enhancing their quality of life.
